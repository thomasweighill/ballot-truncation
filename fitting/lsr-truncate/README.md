# Luce Spectral Ranking with truncation

This is an adaptation of the package below to incorporate a STOP support parameter as part of the Plackett-Luce truncation model.

# Luce Spectral Ranking

This is a Python implementation of the LSR and I-LSR algorithms for
parameter inference in Plackett-Luce models. The algorithms are described in
