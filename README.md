# Simulating ballot truncation
Statistical models of ballot truncation in RCV elections including Plackett-Luce (PL), Independent Truncation (IT) and Fixed Truncation (FT). This repo contains cleaned cast vote records clustered into competing clusters of ballots using the `PLMIX` library (data obtained from the RCV Resource Center). It also contains code for running large sets of simulated elections with two competing voter groups.
