# Simulating ballot truncation

Statistical models of ballot truncation in RCV elections including Plackett-Luce truncation (PL), Independent Truncation (IT) and Fixed Truncation (FT). 

This repo contains 

- `clustered ballots`: cleaned cast vote records clustered into competing clusters of ballots using the `PLMIX` library 
- `simulation code`: code for running large sets of simulated elections with two competing voter groups. 
- `data`: cast vote records obtained from the RCV Resource Center 
- `fitting`: code for fitting the PL and IT models to Cambridge voting data
